This server-side mod adds a couple commands for operators to use.

## Commands

The only currently available command is `/freeze`. 

Detailed information on commands and configuration can be found on [the wiki][wiki].

## My Modpack Policy

So my mod is posted under the MIT license, which meanse you can do a lot with it. However, if you include it in a modpack which is distributed on Modrinth, I would appreciate linking back here and/or inviting me to your project and giving me a small portion of the revenue from the project. This is completely volunteer work for me.

You may fork and edit this project as long as the title doesn't have my username, but again, I would appreciate attribution/revenue sharing.

You may not post unedited copies under any circumstances.
